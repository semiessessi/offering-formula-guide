Learning the standard form of the offering formula, then learning to translate its many variations has been a wonderful exercise to help me learn the language of Ancient Egypt.

Ancestor worship is a near universal religious practice and one of the oldest we know of. The offering formula was important for the particular flavour practised in Ancient Egypt and many hieroglyphic inscriptions are of this kind.

I hope that this book will be useful to those interested in learning hieroglyphs by providing a practical use case and effective reference. I also hope that it will be useful for those seeking to practice the same kind of religion as the ancients.
