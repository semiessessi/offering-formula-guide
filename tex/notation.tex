The transliteration notation used in this book is a variant of the \textit{\indexed{Manuel de Codage}} (MdC), referring to an extended version of \textit{\indexed{Gardiner's sign list}}.

MdC is an Egyptological standard for computer encoding of hieroglyphic text based on the phonetic values. It was first published in 1988 and continues to be revised.

It uses a subset of the Latin alphabet, with capitalisation and Gardiner sign codes used for greater accuracy. It also includes markup characters to encode positioning and arrangement of hieroglyphs, although these will not be used in this book.

In this book a variation is used which prefers phonetic values to sign codes and adds some additional encodings. For convenience this variant is referred to as \indexed{MdC+}.

The Gardiner sign list categorises hieroglyphs into types, and assigns each one a unique code. Although a given \indexed{hieroglyph} may fit into multiple categories, they occur only once, and usually in the first applicable category. It was first published in 1927, although the discovery of new glyphs and variants has required its extension since then.

For example, the hieroglyph G10 portrays a \indexed{falcon}, representing the god \nname{Sokar}, standing on a \indexed{barque} on top of a sled.

It could reasonably fit into the categories G (Birds), P (Ships and parts of ships), R (Temple furniture or sacred emblems) or U (Agriculture, crafts, and professions). It appears only once in the G category.

Transliterations used in this book will place in bold the parts to be vocalised. Any implied or otherwise absent hieroglyphs will be in curved brackets, and determinatives in square brackets. A dot is used to separate the pronoun suffices used in the language from the owning verb or noun.

Note that the following tables do not contain a comprehensive list of modern additions to the original \indexed{Gardiner's sign list}, nor is every hieroglyph listed here referred to later in this book.

These tables define the encoding used throughout this book for transliteration, and to render hieroglyphs in a way that can be vocalised.

\subsection*{Uniliteral signs}

Uniliteral signs represent individual sounds. They give us something like an alphabet, but are not used alone. In many cases they are used as phonetic compliments to assist in reading multiliteral signs.

They are presented separately to give the reader a clear impression of the set of sounds used in the ancient Egyptian language.

\subsection*{Multiliteral and other signs}

These signs are used for compounds of multiple sounds or as determinatives, numbers or grammatical hints. For example, the Z2 and Z3 hieroglyphs occurring early in the table are plural markers. The Z1 hieroglyph is used to denote the end of a word or to fill space between words for a more beautiful composition.
